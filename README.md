# RabbitMQ for RAINBOW project

- This is a standard [rabbitmq](https://rabbitmq.com) for `ARM64v8` hardware with the Management API accessible via IPv6
- The public image is hosted on Docker Hub

## Usage

```bash
docker pull virtualorigami/rabbitmq:0.9.0

docker run -e RABBITMQ_NODENAME=rabbit@localhost \
	   -e RABBITMQ_USERNAME=admin	\
	   -e RABBITMQ_PASSWORD=secure_password_here \
	   virtualorigami/rabbitmq:0.9.0
```

## Problem
For a standard _out-of-the-box_ RabbitMQ management image the management API used for metric collection is accessible only
through IPv4 address. 

Performing a `curl -XGET -u admin:secure_password_here http://[IPv6_Address_Rabbitmq_node]:15672/api/overview` provides
connection refusal errors

### Resolution

enable the `management.tcp.ip = ::` to make it accessible via IPv6
